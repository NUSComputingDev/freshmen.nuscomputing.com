      | FSC was definitely one of the highlights of my summer before school started! It 
      | really helped me adapt to the varsity culture and I met many new friends through the 
      | camp.

          | miss FSC! Our Rag family is extremely bonded and fun-loving; this will be a

              | Going for FSC was the best choice I made before going to university because 
              | I met many people there who became my close friends that I study and have 
              | fun with. FSC is really a camp of exciting and enjoyable activities and is 
              | definitely an unforgettable one!

              | My FSC experience was a great one! FSC is one of the rare opportunities 
              | throughout university life to make friends across different majors! This was 
              | where I was also able to get useful academic advice early on!

              | My time during FSC was great because I managed to meet many seniors who till 
              | now are guiding me in school. Not to mention the friends you'll make even 
              | before school starts, definitely one of the most important events for a 
              | freshman, the friends I made during social camp have stuck with me till 
              | today.

              | Signing up for FSC was definitely the best choice I've made in NUS! The 
              | friends I made from the camp are now my closest friends in school. Even 
              | after two years, we still look back and think about the remarkably fun times 
              | we shared during FSC. Before the camp, I was clueless about all 
              | university-related things, but my Orientation Group Leaders helped change 
              | that! FSC was not only the first but also undoubtedly the best experience 
              | I've had so far!

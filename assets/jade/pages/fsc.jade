      | Iâ€™m honestly very glad that I made the choice to sign up for FSC as 
      | it inserted great fun during the long break after A Levels and gave me 
      | the exposure to other FOP events such as RAG and BASH. More importantly, 
      | it was where I got to know many of my close friends in SoC, friends whom 
      | I study with, chill and sing endless karaoke with throughout the year. ðŸ˜Š

          | day of the camp. This year, we have gathered the most exciting beach games 
          | for you to have a little fun under the sun. Be sure to bring some sunblock

              | I unexpectedly found my life long friends in FSC. Throughout the camp, 
              | the games and nights were spent together helped us get closer to one 
              | another even though we had just met. Despite only knowing each other for 
              | the past few months, we have already gone on an overseas trip together 
              | as an orientation group. FSC is truly a place to find wonderful friends!

              | There were no regrets joining FSC as it was the best way to begin the 
              | summer and kickstart university life. Through the camp, my orientation 
              | group became really bonded and they remain as one of my closest groups 
              | of friends. I also got to know seniors who provided valuable advice that 
              | helped me settle into the new environment quicker.

              | If I were given a chance to become a freshman again, I would definitely 
              | say yes! All thanks to my sweet FSC orientation group leaders who bonded 
              | us freshmen as one and making my fellow OG mates enjoy ourselves right 
              | before school started!! Nevertheless, making my freshman experience was 
              | a breathtaking and an unforgettable one!!

              | FSC is where all the fun people do fun stuff with other fun people. If 
              | I had known, I would have thought FSC stood for Fun Social Camp. It's 
              | basically games and fun all day, it'll feel like you're just partying 
              | it up but that's only if you're up for it. The bulk of your friendships 
              | you'll form is made through these camps. You'll sorely be missing out on 
              | all these great memories you could have made in FSC once you start 
              | university. Trust me you won't regret going FSC. I mean what harm could 
              | there be? Right?

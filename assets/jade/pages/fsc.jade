          | At FSC, freshmen will be introduced to our Rag and Flag family. If you don’t 
          | know what exactly we do at Rag or what this year’s theme is, be sure not to 
          | miss FSC! Our Rag family is extremely bonded and fun-loving; this will be a 
          | great step towards joining us in our amazing journey.

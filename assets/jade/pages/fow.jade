          | Beach days at FOW are no ordinary beach days that you go for in all your other 
          | camps. Our committee members work their very best to ensure that freshmen 
          | get the most unique Beach day experience. Here’s a peek at what our freshmen 
          | went through last year - a good ol’ game of Four Way Tug of War! We’ll leave 
          | it to you to find out what we have in store for you this year

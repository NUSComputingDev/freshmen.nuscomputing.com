      | RAG is an amazing opportunity to try something different, to learn something new.
      | You can learn new moves with dance, or let your creativity run free with float
      | and costumes. You don’t even have to have prior experience, just come down and
      | you’ll be taught everything you need to know.

              | RAG is one of those rare opportunities to make the kind of friends that stick together even after you graduate. If you're the type of person that secretly want to participate then RAG is one of those openings in your Uni life that automatically pulls you into future student life activities. I really encourage all freshmen to give RAG a chance to brighten up your time in NUS. Some tips from a year 3 to a freshman, overnight ragging is your express pass to getting to know people from SoC (maybe you'll hear some juicy gossip too). From personal experience, I had a lot of fun doing RAG last year. It's the spontaneous suppers and the random singing and dancing sessions that happen in the dead of night that you remember from RAG. If you want an experience like that then just drop by the RAG site and ask "how can I help?" and you'll be swept away by the friendliness of SoC seniors. Hope you're as excited to join SoC as we are to see you!

              | Every year's RAG has a different theme, but it's main idea has always been to bond the freshmen into the SoC family and promote the RAG & FLAG spirit among them. RAG 2017 took the same ideas and took it to new heights, introducing an all new REP program and a much better coordinated show. RAG 2017 was meaningful to me because it was my first RAG experience. I was unable to join during my freshman year due to external commitments but I'm glad to have join when I'm year 2. RAG is an unique experience that is not like other freshmen program. RAG is spread across 2 months, allowing us to bond better with one another and forge friendship that is deeper than an usual camp. You also get to learn new skills like sewing. Whether you are an incoming freshmen or a senior, there is definitely a position in RAG for you. RAG 2018 will definitely be better, and as a freshman, you should not miss the chance to participate in such meaningful event to your university life. Join RAG, make friends, leave a legacy behind!

              | RAG? Float, dance, makeup, costume? I couldn’t make sense of how all these could come together to form ‘RAG’. In retrospect, I’m delighted I took the leap of faith and joined RAG with my friends. Through RAG, I have forged friendships where we could all have fun and enjoy our time at SOC together. With very limited opportunities to mingle around and befriending people during school term, RAG serves as a great platform for an interactive and fulfilling experience. We shared memorable late-night sessions touching up on our costumes, slogging through countless rehearsals and trainings, and of course, having fun together. As dancers in RAG, we do not require any background in dance and most people partake RAG without prior dance experience. Learning something new together with friends was sure fun and memorable! I urge you guys to take the leap of faith, give SOC and yourself a chance to experience the epitome of fun before all hell breaks loose when school starts!

              | RAG has given me the opportunity to further friendships forged during FSC. In addition to picking up new interests such as dance, it also allowed me to get to know more students, both seniors and freshmen from School Of Computing and made my freshmen experience so much more vibrant and exciting. If you are looking for a fun start to your university life, join RAG and forge new friendships and create memories that will last!

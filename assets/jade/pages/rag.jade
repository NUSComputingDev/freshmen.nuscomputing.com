      | RAG is an amazing opportunity to try something different, to learn something new. 
      | You can learn new moves with dance, or let your creativity run free with float 
      | and costumes. You don’t even have to have prior experience, just come down and 
      | you’ll be taught everything you need to know.

              |  RAG is a great platform to meet your future batchmates and seniors 
              | from School of Computing. I signed up for RAG dance as I have some prior 
              | dance background. At the start of my RAG journey, I thought that RAG would 
              | be all work and very little fun. However, as time goes by, I met many 
              | amazing, genuine, and kind people which made RAG so much more meaningful. 
              | After RAG ended, many of my friends continued their dance journey by 
              | joining CCAs in NUS. I am joining RAG again this year as the dance head 
              | in hopes to build the culture that the seniors have passed down from my 
              | freshmen year. Also, I hope to inculcate dance fundamentals to the 
              | incoming freshmen and they can pick up new skills. See you during RAG!

              | RAG was indeed one of the most fun and enjoyable experience I had during 
              | the entire course of my orientation in SOC. I went into RAG as a dancer with 
              | no prior experience in dancing at all. However, under patient guidance and 
              | teachings from the seniors, they helped me build my confidence and skills in 
              | dancing such that I was confident enough on the day of the performance. 
              | Through RAG I have picked up new skills and made many friends, most of my 
              | friends in SOC are from RAG. In my opinion, there is nothing to lost and all 
              | to gain from joining RAG.

              | RAG was definitely an enjoyable and unforgettable experience even though 
              | I only took part in RAG in the last 2 weeks before the performance. It was a 
              | short 2 weeks but I forged many friendships and witnessed the dedication of 
              | the seniors which inspired me to join rag again this year as a committee 
              | member because I want to let the freshmen enjoy themselves during rag like I 
              | did.

              | This will be my 3rd year contributing to SoC RAG and I have no #Ragrets 
              | spending my university summers doing RAG. I have seen many different batches 
              | of freshmen coming together to build this unforgettable experience and 
              | making friends that last throughout their university years. My greatest 
              | appreciation to the Freshmen who have no prior experience in performing arts 
              | or float-making yet deciding to join SoC RAG to learn something new anyway. 
              | I feel that SoC RAG is very unique as we focus more on family bonding as one 
              | faculty. Not forgetting the work hard play hard spirit #GoForGoal.

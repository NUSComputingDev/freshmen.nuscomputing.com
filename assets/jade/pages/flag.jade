    | An integral part of NUSSU RAG & FLAG event, FLAG is your opportunity to give back
    | to society! Join us in raising funds on FLAG day which will happen on the 8th of
    | August. Funds raised will go to our beneficiary - Fernvale Gardens School - to support
    | their operations and improve students welfare. You can also sign up as a volunteer to
    | interact with our beneficiary, brighten up the lives of the students, and know who
    | you're really flagging for on FLAG day!

      | I interacted with students who were intellectually challenged and found it to be
      | a very meaningful experience. FLAG gave me the opportunity to better understand
      | and really see who we are flagging for and this further strengthens the true
      | meaning and purpose of FLAG.

          | School. Join us in this meaningful day as we give back to the society. We will
          | also be having a Flag day in August for you to do a little something for our

              | FLAG gave me the valuable opportunity to give back to society, completing
              | the orientation package. It enabled me to further understand what it meant
              | to touch the lives of others. Though it wasn’t easy communicating with the
              | students, we managed to teach them a variety of things such as purchasing
              | and colouring. All you need is 2Ps - patience & perseverance - to put a
              | smile on their faces, plant the seed of hope in them, and brighten up their
              | lives that little bit more.

              | It was a meaningful experience raising funds for our beneficiary Fernvale
              | Garden School through FLAG day and going down to the school for engagement
              | sessions with the students. It was definitely a great experience as we could
              | bond with the students whom we are raising funds for even though it was
              | difficult to get close to them initially. Nevertheless, I had an amazing
              | time with my newly-found friends from FSC and the students from the school!

              | FLAG was an enriching experience for me. Interacting with the kids at our
              | beneficiary made me realise just how small and feeble an individual’s effort
              | make on the lives of these kids. We need more awareness and help for them.
              | All I can do is make them smile for a day but with the help of the general
              | public’s generous donations, the beneficiaries will have more funds to truly
              | help them assimilate back into society.

              | It was one of the most meaningful experiences I have ever had. I've
              | never been a huge "kids person", but I felt so welcomed by the children
              | there. Even though the activities that we planned for them were fairly
              | simple, I could see that they really enjoyed themselves. You could see how
              | much the children appreciated our effort, just by the look of joy in their
              | eyes. By the end of the day, many of us had forged such strong bonds with
              | them that it was really hard to say goodbye. It felt like they were
              | contented just spending time with us. It left me wanting to do so much more
              | for them.

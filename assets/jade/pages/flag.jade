    | Other than the exciting preparations for RAG day, there will also be a chance for 
    | you to give back to the society by joining our FLAG events. We will be going 
    | down to our beneficiary’s, Fernvale Gardens School for a fulfilling day of 
    | interaction with their residents through fun activities. On top of that, 
    | join us on our quest to give back to society by raising funds for 
    | Fernvale Gardens School on FLAG day, which will be happening on the 8th of August!

      | FLAG is an amazing opportunity to try something different, to learn something new. 
      | You can learn new moves with dance, or let your creativity run free with float 
      | and costumes. You don’t even have to have prior experience, just come down and 
      | you’ll be taught everything you need to know.

          | At Rag, we make dreams come true. If you have ever dreamt about being part of a 
          | team who builds something magnificent, Rag is the place for you. Join us floaters 
          | in building the most amazing structures you have only dreamed of, and have a say 
          | in what SoC should build this year.

          | Rag is not just about choosing to be in Float, Dance, Makeup or Costumes. 
          | Our Raggers come together to put up their very best performance regardless of 
          | which team they belong to! Here’s our head makeup artist last year painting a 
          | happy dancer’s face before the big day.

          | with NO prior experience. Be assured that we have the most talented and patient 
          | choreographers waiting to introduce you to the swag that is dance. Girls, we 
          | want you too!

          | In light of the spirit of Rag, our costumes over the past few years have always 
          | been hand-made by our very own Costumes team. If you are creative and want to 
          | do a little handiwork, join our Costumes team in dressing up our dancers for 
          | the big day!

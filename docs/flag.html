					As part of NUSSU RAG & FLAG event, FLAG provides students with the 
					opportunity to give back to society. Apart from FLAG day which is a 
					one day activity for students to go to designated locations around 
					Singapore for fundraising, Beneficiary Engagement Day (BEDs) are also 
					organized for students to interact with our beneficiaries. All of the 
					funds raised will go to our beneficiary – Fernvale Gardens School – 
					to improve the student welfare and support their operations. We 
					encourage you to join us as a volunteer to interact with our 
					beneficiary, engage in fun-filled activities and have a good time 
					with the students! This will make your FLAG day experience more 
					meaningful knowing who you’re really flagging for!

				It had been quite some time since I’ve wanted to do something 
				meaningful in my life. Thus, being involved with Movement for the 
				Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS) during the Beneficiary 
				Day 2017 gave me a great opportunity to help children who were not 
				as fortunate as me. It warms my heart when I saw the intellectually 
				disabled children smile and were having fun while enjoying the 
				activities that we’ve prepared for them in school. This made me 
				realized that genuinely spending time with them brings simple 
				happiness to them. Nevertheless, I hope to continue to volunteer 
				at MINDS for many semesters to come as it always feels good 
				volunteering out of goodwill!

							BED was a meaningful experience and left me with deep memories 
							while I embarked my new journey in NUS School of Computing, 
							giving back to the society. After the first engagement, it was 
							an eye opener for me to see how the caregivers and teachers 
							catered to different children with different needs and adjust 
							their attitude towards them accordingly. I must admit it was not
							easy as I was not trained nor fully prepared to deal with 
							situations where there’s a sudden mental breakdown which I 
							experienced it in my first engagement. I felt regretful as I 
							do not know what to do. Hence, I observed and learnt as much 
							as I could from the teachers and make an improvement in myself 
							to better cater to these children during my second engagement 
							experience. Overall, BED gave me an insightful learning 
							experience and things I never once knew about these children. 
							I learnt so much about their needs and the difficulties in 
							portraying their feelings up front as well as discovering the 
							distinct talent in each child.
							<p><i>Rachel Tan, Year 1 Computer Science Student</i></p>
						</td>
						<td class="testimonial-data">
							FLAG and the Beneficiary Engagement Day (BED) is an opportunity 
							that you will have to raise funds for and interact with special 
							needs children from Fernvale Gardens School. In BED, we were able 
							to interact with them, understand them, feel for them. They were 
							so happy to welcome us! Their cheery laughter was contagious, and 
							it’s really the simple things that one remembers like the way they 
							called us Kor Kor and Jie Jie as they invited us to play with them. 
							And this was a timely reminder for us as we embarked on a new 
							chapter in life. You have two hands; one is for helping yourself 
							and the other is for helping others. 
							<p><i>Nicklaus Ong, Year 1 Business Analytics Student</i></p>

					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="testimonial-data">
							I am very thankful that BED was organized for us as it provided 
							me with an opportunity to give back to the community. Spending time 
							with the less privileged children made me realize the little things 
							I often take for granted, which motivates me to make the best out of 
							the short session I have with them by bringing joy to their lives. 
							Upon interacting with these children, FLAG day became more meaningful 
							for me because I know who I am flagging for and it encouraged me to 
							do my best for these children. I am glad to know that SOC has 
							organized this meaningful CIP activity and I do hope that SOC can 
							organize more of such meaningful engagement sessions. 
							<p><i>Koh Zhi Ming, Year 1 Information Systems Student</i></p>
						</td>
						<td class="testimonial-data">
							The Beneficiary Engagement Day (BED) is a great opportunity to 
							contribute back to the community. As volunteers, we get to interact 
							with these students and better understand them. Teachers from Fernvale 
							Gardens School are extremely knowledgeable whenever us volunteers have 
							doubts in approaching the students. Volunteering for BED reminds us of 
							the things that we often take for granted for and allows us to 
							appreciate the little things in life.
